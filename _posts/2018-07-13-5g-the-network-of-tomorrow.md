Do you know how long cell phone networks have been around? You might be surprised to learn that they've been in existence since 1973 in some form or another. The creators didn't optimize the first networks for international calls, much less the affordable plans that are offered now. 


And that leads to what the topic would be about today. Presenting the 5G Network!

### Comparing 5G and 4G
You may ask: What, then is this 5G network and what is so special about it? What’s the difference between a 4G and 5G network? 

Well, the catch about 5G is that it’s faster than 4G and cheaper too.

4G wireless technology provides the foundation for 5G. Unlike 4G, which requires high-power cell towers to radiate signals, 5G wireless signals will be transmitted via many small cell stations. 

In the future, 5G will be able to transit at least 20 gigabytes of data per second at its peak limit, unlike 4G which has only 100Mbit/s, which equivalent to around 12.5 Megabytes.

With a 5G network, we will be able to do almost everything on our mobile phones. No more lagging videos, or loading pages. Think of all the possibilities this network could bring!

### How does 5G help?
To us, 5G could improve our lives drastically. 5G is basically a new technological revolution, with the high speeds and short response time bringing a new wave of high-tech things like robots or maybe even better laptops.

With 5G wireless equipment standards almost complete and the first 5G-compliant smartphones and associated wireless devices to be commercially available in 2019, by 2030, 5G services will become mainstream and are expected to range from the delivery of virtual reality (VR) content to autonomous vehicle navigation enabled by real-time communications capabilities.

### Some disadvantages?
Personally, 5G is a brilliant idea. However, in the future, 5G networks may be very expensive to implement in cities, with countries needing funds and money to build the cell stations. To overcome this, 5G could be tested and implemented for an affordable price at cities like Singapore.

### Future Improvements 
Another improvement for 5G networks could also be that instead of cell stations, satellites could be implemented for global network use no matter where you are. However, the technology needed for that are not cheap, so this idea may just be the next 6G network.

### What if Singapore has 5G?
Should Singapore have 5G, our lives would improve in terms for the better. We can have at least 1 Gigabyte of browsing per second and we may have many more robots in the making with even faster connectivity to help us do our daily activities. Robots can help in surgeries, daily chores, to say the least.

Courses if you want
In summary, we cannot fit all the information we can give about general networking in this essay, so we have found a lynda course about Networking for you to delve a little deeper into WiFi.  Thank you!
