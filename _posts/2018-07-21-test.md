This is some body text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Assumenda rerum vel, eius, id hic consequatur repellendus perspiciatis iusto. Aperiam, expedita.

Leave a whole new line for a paragraph;
just a line break by itself doesn't do anything.

<!-- This is a comment, same as html -->
Styling includes *italic words* and __bold text__, and *__both__* at _**the same time**_
You can use _either_ * or _ for **formatting**.

# Header level 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6
These are built into HTML \<h1-6\>. You'll need to escape symbols used for markdown; if a symbol isn't showing up, try adding backslashes to escape them, like \*this\*.

Inline code can be written with `backticks`. To do blocks of code with syntax highlighting, 

```html
<h1>Yes</h1>
```

## Tables

| Tables columns | are separated |
| with | pipes |
| and don't *have* | to be aligned. |

Just leave a line after the table.

## Quoting
To make something look like a quote, use `>`:

> this is a backquote. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ducimus, vitae.
> ## Also,
> you can also have **formatting** and _headers_ in backquotes,
and you don't need to include the \> for consecutive lines, but there won't be a line break.

> If you want a new quote, leave a new line and start another quote.

To end the quote, leave a new line.

## Lists
Lists can be made with * or -:

* this is an unordered list
* items

    can have some text between them, just add newlines and a tab in front 

- this is also a list item
    * for sub-lists, add a tab in front
        * and another tab

1. Ordered lists are like unordered lists, just with numbers
1. You don't need to keep track of the numbers themselves. 

## Links and images

Links look like [this](https://google.com).

Alternatively, you can use reference-style links like [this][reference-to-bing] and add a list of links wherever, usually at the end of the file or section.

[reference-to-bing]: https://bing.com

You can also include title ('hover') text to your [links](https://google.com "like this"), as well as for [reference links][another-reference-to-bing]

[another-reference-to-bing]: https://bing.com "This time there's hover text!"

Images look like this:

![Alt text](http://placehold.it/600x400 "Title text")

You can hotlink for now, more details for uploading images will be given once the site is up.

## If all else fails,
Markdown passes HTML through to results, so you can just include HTML tags if you want.
<h4>Like this!</h4>
<style>
    /* and you can even include stylesheets and scripts */
    #custom { color: green }
</style>
in case you need some <span id="custom">customization</span>

Try not to put so many extra stuff in an article file though; there'll be other boilerplate around the article, so don't worry too much about styling for now.

## That's about it
You can try an [online markdown editor](https://dillinger.io/) and play around with markdown syntax.
